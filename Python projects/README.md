## Python projects

These are two games that I created with python. 

The Math Game uses the tkinter package to create an interactable GUI that gives simple math problems and keeps track of how many are answered correctly. 

The NimGame starts with one or more "heaps" of one or more items (we'll call them balls). Players take turns with the computer removing one or more balls from any heap. If the player removes the last ball before the computer they win.
