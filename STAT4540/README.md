Analyzed several data sets using R, including a breast cancer diagnostic data set. Using several classifications approaches,
I trained a variety of models for predicting the malignancy of a breast tumor using three imaging-based predictors.

* Fit linear regression, logistic regression, LDA, QDA, and K-NN Models on the data and created confusion Matrices to 
compare the sensitivity and specificity of the models.
* Used 10-fold cross-validation to construct curves for the overall error rate and accuracy in correctly 
classifying the Malignant tumors.
* Applied Bootstrap to construct 95% confidence intervals for the data sets.
