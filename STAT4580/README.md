## Art Through the Years

This is the final project that I completed in STAT4580 Data Visualization and Data Technologies, the project itself serves as an analysis of the Tate institutions of art. In the project I use R to investigate some trends among the art and the artists over the course of the last few hundred years. This included answering the questions: Where do artists come from? Does the general location of artists change over the years? Does the gender ratio change as years go on? Does the size of art fluctuate? How long does it take for an art piece to be taken in by the Tate institutions?



It is required to install the following packages for the code to run: tidyverse, countrycode, Knitr, maps and scales.
